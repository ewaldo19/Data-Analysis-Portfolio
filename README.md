# Ewaldo Samuel - My Data Analysis Project Portfolio 
## About Me
Hello! I'm Ewaldo Samuel, currently I am on progress in finishing my Bachelor Degree in Information Systems. I have developed a keen interest in the field of data analytics, which I have used to discover relevant and interesting information. It is without a question that I would love to showcase my ability as entry-level data analyst in the real world.

During my 4th and 5th semester, I chose Applied Database as my selective course to improve my skills in the field of data. It was really a valuable lesson to learn that SQL has so many uses to analyze raw and complex data, and I also used Tableau as a tool for Data Visualization.
