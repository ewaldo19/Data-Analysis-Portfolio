# Ewaldo Samuel - My Data Analysis Project Journey
## About Me
Hello! I'm Ewaldo Samuel, currently I am on progress in finishing my Bachelor Degree in Information Systems. I have developed a keen interest in the field of data analytics, which I have used to discover relevant and interesting information. It is without a question that I would love to showcase my ability as entry-level data analyst in the real world.

During my studies , I chose Applied Database as my selective course to improve my skills in the field of data. It was really a valuable lesson to learn that SQL has so many uses to analyze raw and complex data, used various Python libraries to Web scrape and store the web scraped data in a relational database, and I also explored various tools to visualize the data that I have gathered such as Tableau, Python, and Excel. I am sure that the skills I have studied will be very useful for my role as a Data Analyst.

This repository is created with the purpose to display the projects that I have created in the field of Data Analytics.
