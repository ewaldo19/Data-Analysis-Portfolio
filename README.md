<h1>Ewaldo Samuel - My Data Analysis Project Journey</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<body><p align="justify">Hello! I'm Ewaldo Samuel, currently I am on progress in finishing my Bachelor Degree in Information Systems. I have developed a keen interest in the field of data analytics, which I have used to discover relevant and interesting information. It is without a question that I would love to showcase my ability as entry-level data analyst in the real world.</p>

<p align = "justify">During my studies , I chose Applied Database as my selective course to improve my skills in the field of data. It was really a valuable lesson to learn that SQL has so many uses to analyze raw and complex data, used various Python libraries to web scrape, I also learned how to store the web scraped data in a relational database, and I also explored various tools to visualize the data that I have gathered such as using Tableau, Metabase, Python, and Microsoft Excel. My favourite tool is Python, which I usually use Plotly to visualize the data because I believe it is the most interactive and has such a wide range of usage. I am sure that the skills I have studied will be very useful for my role as a Data Analyst.</p>
